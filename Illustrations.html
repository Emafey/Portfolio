  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>The main challenges within these pieces were mostly on detail, and texture. Although the base layers of color and shape were simple to do, when it came down to the details, it became rather difficult. When zoomed in, many individual brush strokes were visible and this sometimes made the piece look messy. It was difficult to find a balance between the brush strokes and texture within a piece, but the use of multiple brush sets ultimately helped with the finish of final image. <br><br> Another challenge came through perspective. As I do not have a lot of experience with advanced perspective, it was difficult to implement complex ideas relating to it. Cityscapes and clusters of geometric shapes were often avoided because of that, and a more 2D graphic style was applied when dealing with them. ​<br><br> Takeaways include more in-depth knowledge about lighting, and color. Both are an important factor to the atmosphere of a piece. Rather than working on sections of the piece somewhat separately, I realized that blending in one layer and working on the piece all at once was better for unity. I now start by putting giant dabs of color together on a blank canvas, and begin blocking in general shapes and details. <br><br> Lighting was also kept in mind, and what time of day and type of light would be present in the scene. If the light source was a cool color, I wold make the shadows warm and vice versa. With everything combined I find that this would often create a more unified end piece, with all the elements blending in together in a similar style rather than them clashing with each other.</p>
